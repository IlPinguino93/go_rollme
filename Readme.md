## Disclaimer

I'm not responsible for money lost, beverages spent, clothing removed or other damages due to gambling games played with this. This does not use a cryptographically secure random generator. If you require more secure random diceroll generation, I recommend using actual hardware dice or seeing a therapist for your paranoia. You must be fun at parties.
